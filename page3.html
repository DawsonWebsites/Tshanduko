                            <p class="mbr-text align-right mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Brian is a well presented, articulate and well-spoken, skilled educationalist , with a unique capacity to connect with both young and old people alike. He is highly motivated with an understanding of the importance of modern educational paradigms with the capacity to inspire and lead. He is passionate about youth and the potential to bring out the best in young people. Indeed, his fundamental strength relies on getting the best out of those around him.
<br><br>Significantly, his exposure to the global youth development arena has been quite exceptional. As the Executive Director of Round Square, he was fortunate to visit and explore a significant number and wide range of schools across the globe and to examine curricula and philosophies on a broad and varied level and to engage with young people from diverse, and in some cases challenging backgrounds.
<br><br>He has a well-developed skill set that includes a high level of strategic analysis and includes sound judgement, critical thinking, complex problem solving and active learning. This is reinforced with excellent management skills, embracing time management, performance management and people management. He also has a high degree of social competence and confidently demonstrate an aptitude for active listening, communication, social perceptiveness, and an understanding and insight into the emotional capacity of young and old alike.&nbsp;<br><br>Interests         
<br>My personal interests include sport (ruby and cricket), family, wild life, outdoors, travel, technology, cooking and music. <br> 
<br> Personal details
<br>Married (1983) to Angela
<br>Children: Warrick (28) Andrew (25), Hayley (23)
<br><br>Outlook
<br>I have a passion for the upliftment of youth and the provision of dignity with a prolific career in education and youth development. I have been very fortunate to visit and interact with many, many young people, schools and institutions across the world and believe in the purpose of education for a better world.
<br><br> Education, I believe, is in part about the end product â€“ producing young men and young women able to make a meaningful contribution to society and to safeguard the natural environment; preferably as self-sufficient work generators, not work seekers, and certainly where possible, able to benefit from higher education, and to lead fulfilling and productive lives. <br><br>To achieve this, we need schools that inspire curiosity, creativity, an entrepreneurial spirit and compassion in its pupils. Schools that enrich the learners with the enjoyment and understanding of their particular linguistic, environmental and cultural heritage. <br><br>Schools that empower the pupils with the knowledge, courage, skills and independence of mind that will make them effective and responsible citizens, and potential leaders, of the world they will inherit.&nbsp;<br></p>
